      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I wanted to become a Medical Doctor. I came second in my district, first place among all public schools. I took every single trophy for every single subject I took. I took Physics, Life Sciences, Information Technology and AP Math, and still I am among the students from my high school that didn't get in for medicine. True story but I think this is decent for the word count.</p>

      <h3>Latest Project</h3>
        <p>My project, AppliCare, is a learning management system (LMS) designed for a private university that allows students to register for courses, keeps track of their fees and grades, and gives them information about the overall historical performance of students in the courses that they have signed up for. In addition, it offers them links to third-party websites to acquire textbooks and learning materials. It also allows lecturers and admins to oversee registrations and class performance. Students can also keep track of their current fees.</p>
