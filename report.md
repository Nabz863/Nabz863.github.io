1. I initialised the Git repository Nabz863.github.io, signed in on the VS Code terminal and cloned the repository.
2. I created the student-info.txt, report.md and index.html files and populated the student-info.txt file before updating this file.
3. I committed the above files and pushed them.
4. I switched to the feature/student-details branch, made minor changes and committed them. I then created and accepted the pull and merge requests.
5. I populated the index.html file
6. I updated the report.md file and committed the final changes.
